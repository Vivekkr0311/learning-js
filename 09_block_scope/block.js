    //This is a block. This is also called 'Compound statement'.

    //Multiple javascript commands is grouped into a block. Like this
    var a = 10;
    console.log(a);


    //Reason for grouping multiple javascript statements:
    //We group multiple statements into a single block, so that we can use this one block
    //where javascript expects to have only one statement.
