const cart ["shoes", "pants", "kurta"];

createOrder(cart, function(orderID){
    proceedToPayment(orderID);
});

Here, we passing our callback in createOrder API, and blindly trusting it.
We are giving control of our program to this API.
We are passing callback inside another function.

const promise = createOrder(cart);
promise.then(function(orderID){
    proceedToPayment(orderID);
});

But here, we are attaching our function to promise.
We are attaching callback to promise object.
We are not lossing control of our program.

There is difference between Passing a callback and attaching a callback.
