Q1: What is Closure in javascript ??
Ans: A function with its outer environment forms a Closure.
    In other words, closure is combination of function and its lexical
    scope bundled together, forms a Closure.

Q2: Can you explain little bit more about Closure ??
Ans: Eacn and every function in javascript has access to its
    lexical environment, means it has access variable and stuff
    present in its parent.
    So even when these function are executed in different scope not
    in original scope, it still remembers its outer lexical environment
    where it was originally present in the code.

Q3: Can you give example of this whatever you explained ??
Ans: function outer(){
        var a = 10;
        function inner(){
            console.log(a);
        }
        return inner;
    }

    outer()();

Q4: What did you do outer()() ??
Ans: outer()() is used here to execute the function which is returned by outer();.
    It is same as writing:

    var close = outer();
    close();
