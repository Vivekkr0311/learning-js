To access all features of our web browser, in javascript we use "web apis".

Some "web apis" are:
 - setTimeout() -> setTimeout is not a part of the javascript.
 - DOM api      -> It is also not part of the javascript. (document.addListener )
 - fetch()      -> Not part of the javascript.
 - LocalStorage -> Not part of the javascript.
 - console      -> Not part of the javascript. (console.log())
 - Location     -> Not part of the javascript.
 - and there are a lot more.

Javascript engine give all these power to use these features of web browser.
In browsers we make use of these browser feature using global object in case of browsers
we have global object "window".

So, if you want to use "setTimeout".
You have to use "window.setTimeout()".
But as these "web apis" are present in global object, we can use them without mention "window".
like: "setTimeout" instead of "window.setTimeout"
