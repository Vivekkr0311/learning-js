Q: What is fetch();
ans: fetch() it basically makes a API call. This fetch() function returns a "promise".
     We pass a callback function to this fetch() function, this callback function is executed
     when this promise is resolved.

     This callback function is not executed directly.
     When this promise is resolved, the callback function provided in fetch() function is put into
     the "MicroTask Queue", this queue is similar to "callback queue" but it stores such callback functions
     which are related to promises.
     And "MicroTask Queue" has higher priority than the "callback queue".
     Then our event loop will keep checking if the callstack is empty, then if it finds some functions
     inside "callback queue" or "MicroTask queue" then it will take it and execute it.
