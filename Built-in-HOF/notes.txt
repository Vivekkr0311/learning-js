map: map function is used to transform an array. You can pass one array and get a different array.
    example:
            arr = [5, 1, 3, 2, 6]

            Then you can get:
                double = [10, 2, 6, 4, 12]
                triple = [30, 3, 9, 6, 18]
                or
                binary = ["101", "1", "11", "10", "110"]
    - we give array name and then using "." operator on that array we call the function "map".
      This "map" function takes a logic as input which tells "map" how to transform this array.
