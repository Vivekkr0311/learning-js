map: map function is used to transform an array. You can pass one array and get a different array.
    example:
            arr = [5, 1, 3, 2, 6]

            Then you can get:
                double = [10, 2, 6, 4, 12]
                triple = [30, 3, 9, 6, 18]
                or
                binary = ["101", "1", "11", "10", "110"]
    - we give array name and then using "." operator on that array we call the function "map".
      This "map" function takes a logic as input which tells "map" how to transform this array.

filter: filter funtion is used to filter values inside an array.

reduce: reduce takes all values of the array, and comes with single value for these values.
        reduce is used in the places where you want to iterate over the array and compute
        some value.
