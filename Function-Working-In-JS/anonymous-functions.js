//What is a anonymous function ??
//Anonymous function is function is a function wihtout a name.
//Anonymous functions do not have their own identity.

//Like:
//This will give a syntax error. Because while creating functions using statement requires a name.

function (){

}

//So, if it give a syntax error what is use of anonymous function.

//Anonymous function are use in the places where we need function as value.
//So, anonymous function are used to assign a function in a value.
//Like:
var b =  function(){

}

//In this function expression we used anonymous function to assign to a variable.
//But we cannot use anonymous function with function statements.
