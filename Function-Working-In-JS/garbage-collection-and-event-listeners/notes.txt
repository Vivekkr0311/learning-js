Everytime we create a event listener a Closure is formed with it.
And this closure always stays in the memory, because we don't when we may need
to call this event listener.

So if we have so many event listener in our page then all these event listner will form a closure
and these will consume lot of memory which can make our page very slow.

To avoid such situations we remove this event listeners from javascript memory,
and when these event listeners are removed by us, then javascript garbage collector
will remove all the variable held by the closure of these event listener.
