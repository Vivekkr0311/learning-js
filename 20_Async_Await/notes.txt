* What is async ??
-> async is a keyword, which is used before function name to create
   a async function.

* What is async function ?
-> async functions always returns a promise.

* What is await ?
-> We use await in front of the Promise.
   await is the keyword that can only be used inside an
   async function to handle Promises. And these Promises are asynchronous.

* async and await are used together to handle Promises.

* Javascript does not actually wait, it appears to be waiting. The function is suspended from the callstack
  for that time. In between if something else comes in the callstack,javascript executes that thing quickly.

* Async await vs Promise.then/ .catch
-> Async Await is just a syntactic sugar over the .then and .catch.
   Using syntactic sugar, means behind the scene Javascript using the same
   .then .catch, so the only affect that is happening, is in the way you write
   code.

   When you write Promises in traditional way using .then .catch, you have to do
   Promise chaining. But here, we don't need to do Promise chaining.

   Async Await just make code easy to read and write.
