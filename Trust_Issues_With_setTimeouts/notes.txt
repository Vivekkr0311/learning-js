Suppose you have this code:
    function cb(){
        console.log("Callback");
    }
    setTimeout(cb, 5000);

    //And millions of line of code is here.

Lets say this millions of line code takes 10 seconds to execute.
In this case, callback function of setTimeout will not execute untill
this million of lines of code is finished executing.

This is why people say "Don't block the main thread".
Here, millions of line of code was blocking the main thread (the callstack).
This is why, callback of timeout did not get chance to get into the callstack and execute.
