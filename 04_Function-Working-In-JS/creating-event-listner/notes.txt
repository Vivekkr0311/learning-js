When button is clicked, then the callback function which is passed into the function
"addEventListener" is put into the callstack, so that it will be executed by the javascript.
Otherwise javascript will keep this callback somewhere else and will until the button is clicked,
as soon as button is clicked javascript puts this callback function into the callstack.
