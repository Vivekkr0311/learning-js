Things learned:
1. setTimeout stores the function in a different place and attached a timer to it, when the timer is finished it rejoins the call stack and executed.
2. Without closure the var reference gives the latest value as it does not retain the original value but rather has the reference so any update in value after timeout will be shown.
3. If we use let/const because they have block scope, every time a new copy of variable is attached, thus this can be done without closure.

* What setTimeout does ??

-> Wherever a functions goes in javascript, it takes it closuer with it.
   and setTimeout takes the call back function and stores it to some place and
   attaches a timeout to it.

   And then javascript proceeds to next line and execute those line of code. When the time expires
   javascript takes the functions and puts it again in the call stack and runs it.
