There are four major Promise APIs.
1. Promise.all()
2. Promise.allSettled()
3. Promise.race()
4. Promise.any()

1. Promise.all(): Suppose you have to make parallel API calls.
                In such cases this is used. When we need to handle
                multiple Promises together (multiple API calls).

                Promise.all(), it takes array of promies as a input.
                eg: Promise.all([p1, p2, p3])
                This will make three parallel API calls.

                Let's say p1 takes 3 secs to resolve,
                p2 takes 1 sec and p3 takes 2 secs.

                Once these all are resolved, Promise.all() will give us back
                array having result of all these API calls. It will wait for all of these to complete.
