Javascript engine is used almost everywhere.
Javascript can run inside.
 - Browser
 - Server
 - Smartwatch
 - Ligthbulb (smart bulb)
 - Robots

 Javascript can run on all these devices because of Javascript Runtime Environment.
 Javascript runtime environment is like a big container which has everything which is required
 to run javascript code.

This javascript runtime environment has:
  - Javascript engine: To run any javascript code, you need javascript engine.
  - Set of APIs: These APIs are used to connect to outer environment.
  - Event loop: Which task is to execute callbacks which are inside "MircoTask Queue" and "Callback Queue".
  - MicroTask Queue: Callbacks associated with fetch are kept here.
  - Callback Queue: Callback associated with DOM alteration will be kept here.

Javascript engine is the heart of the javascript runtime environment.
Browsers can run your javascript code just because of browsers has Javascript Runtime Environment.

Node.js also has Javascript Runtime Environment. Node.js can run javascript code outside the browser.
Different Javascript Runtime Environment has different APIs calls for connecting to outer environment,
some can be same, some APIs can be different.

You can find on internet there are lot of javascript engines.
 - Microsoft browser has javscript enginer known as "Chakara".
 - Mozilla Firefox has "SpiderMonkey".
 - Google Chrome has "v8". This "v8" is also used in "node.js". "v8" is written in Low Level Language C++.

 You can create your own javascript engine as well. Any javascript engine
 must follow ECMAScript standards. ECMAScript is like governer of javascript.
